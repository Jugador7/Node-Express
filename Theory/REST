There are five requirements for an API to be considered
RESTful, plus one optional criterion:
1. The API leverages a client-server architecture made up of resources that are managed and
delivered via HTTP
2. Communication between client and server is stateless
3. Data is cacheable to improve performance on the client side
4. The interface is transferred in a standard format such that the requested resources stored on the
server are separated from the representation sent to the client. The representation sent to the
client contains sufficient data so that the client can manipulate the representation
5. Requests and responses communicate through different layers, such as middleware. The client
and server often do not communicate directly with each other.
6. (Optional) Resources are usually static but can also contain executable code. The code should
only be executed when the client requests it
